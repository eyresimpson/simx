> The Simx core processor is a core stream processor provider for the Simx engine, and after version 1.1.0, all stream
> processors in the engine were moved into this project.

> We tried to split the engine into the smallest running units to increase the maintainability of the project and reduce
> the use of unnecessary dependent libraries
